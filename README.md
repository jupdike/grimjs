# GrimJS

Experimental code to implement the parser for a functional language, grim, in JS (PegJS) so it can be very portable, to run on web, Mac, iOS, iPadOS (anywhere JS can run).

GrimJS is inspired by Fredrik Johansson's [Grim](https://fungrim.org/grim/) / [PyGrim](https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/fungrim/tree/master/pygrim) and [FunGrim](https://fungrim.org/), the Mathematical Functions Grimoire.

The functional language GrimJS is built out of small parts, with a goal of bootstrapping the minimal language needed to build a bigger system / libraries in Grim itself. Then the core could be ported, for example to C, and run anywhere.

Work in Progress.
